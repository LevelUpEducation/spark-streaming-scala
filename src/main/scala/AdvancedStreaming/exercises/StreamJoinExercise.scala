	/**
	  * Exercise:
	  *
	  * Use the join() function to print a list of trending Twitter hashtags with their count from
	  * the last 30 seconds and the last 3 minutes.
	  * The most popular ones should be at the top, ordered by the highest count from the short time
	  * frame primarily and by the count from the longer time frame secondarily.
	  * You may limit the hashtags to a language of your choice.
	  *
	  * Example Output (HashTags in English):
	  *
	  * (#HereWeGo,(2,5))
	  * (#HappyNewYear,(2,5))
	  * (#Promotion,(2,4))
	  * (#Browns,(1,6))
	  * (#Iran,(1,3))
	  * (#IranProtests,(1,3))
	  * (#InBrotherhood,(1,2))
	  * (#Bucs,(1,2))
	  * (#GoHawks,(1,2))
	  * (#JDSellsEm,(1,1))
