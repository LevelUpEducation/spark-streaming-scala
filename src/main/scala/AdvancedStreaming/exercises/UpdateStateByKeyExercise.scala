	/**
	  * Exercise:
	  *
	  * Count the number of words in titles of Reddit posts. Determine the most common numbers of words by
	  * counting their occurrence and use the updateStateByKey() function to aggregate the counts. Sort the
	  * output by the accumulated counts in descending order. Update your output every five seconds.
	  * Depending of the time of day you may have more or less data to work with. Using a very common
	  * keyword can help to get a decent amount of data flowing in.
	  * Bonus task: Print how many new titles arrived in each streaming interval
	  *
	  * Example Output:
	  *
	  * Most common word count in Reddit titles (20 new titles):
	  * 5 words: 13
	  * 4 words: 10
	  * 8 words: 9
	  * 7 words: 8
	  * 2 words: 8
	  * 1 words: 5
	  * 6 words: 5
	  * 12 words: 4
	  * 13 words: 3
	  * 18 words: 2
	  * 16 words: 2
	  * 14 words: 1
